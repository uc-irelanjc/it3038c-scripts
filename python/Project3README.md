For porject 3 I created a game in python. The game is a turtle race and the turles move towards the finsih line based off of dice rolls.
How to play:
- Step 1: Copy and paste the code into Visual Studio and save the project as a .py file
- Step 2: Run the game by typing 'python 'projectname.py'' where project name is what ever you saved the script as
- Step 3: Player 1 presses any key followed by enter to roll the dice
- Step 4: Player 2 presses any key followed by enter to roll the dice
- Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a turtle crosses the fish line. Winner will be announced and the game is over.
- Step 6: To exit and reset the game click anywhere in the games window.
